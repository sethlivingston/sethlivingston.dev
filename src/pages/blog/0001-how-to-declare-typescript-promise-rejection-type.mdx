Consider a utility function that returns a rejected Promise.

```typescript
export function rejectWithNumber(n: number): Promise<number> {
  return Promise.reject(n);
}
```

This compiles, but the return type declaration isn't correct.

> In `Promise<T>`, `T` is the **fulfillment** type. The **rejection** type is always `any`.

So what's the correct return type declaration for the function?

```typescript
export function rejectWithNumber(n: number): Promise<any> {
  return Promise.reject(n);                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^
}
```

This is a little confusing, though.

This function doesn't return a `Promise<any>` because the rejection type is always `any`. It returns a `Promise<any>` because it doesn't know what the Promise's fulfilled type is. Only the calling function knows.

It's not possible to declare the TypeScript Promise rejection type. It's always `any`.
